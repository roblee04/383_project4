# Swapping and Paging  
The purpose of this assignment is to explore the various memory management   algorithms for swapping and paging. You will write a series  of small simulation  programs  in Java, C, or C++ (your choice). As in Assignment #2, you will generate  simulated  processes  <Process Name,  Process size  in pages, arrival time,  service  duration> using random number generator.  You should not need to make any process management system calls.  

## Workload Generation  
Assume main memory has 100 MB with  page size of 1 MB.  Processes have randomly and evenly distributed sizes of  5, 11, 17, and 31  MB.  Processes have randomly and evenly distributed service durations of  1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 seconds. Assume that free pages are structured as a linked list, and when  a process needs a free page we pick the page from the head  of the  free  linked list. Generate around 150 new random processes  into a Job Queue linked list sorted based on arrival time. A job at the head of the Job Queue is taken out and assigned memory to run if there is at least 4 free pages that can be assigned to that job (i.e., initially only 25 jobs will run. When  a  Job run, we  need initially one page (page-0) and then the process will make a memory reference to another page in that process and we need to page-in the referenced page from disk if the page is not already in memory.  Once  a jobs are  in memory, the processes run independently and simultaneously  for their durations.  

## Paging:  
Assume  as an example  you are running a process that consists of  11  pages numbered 0 through 10.  Assume when start executing this process there is only  free  4  pages  Physical  memory  frames. There are always 11  page frames available on  disk. When  the process starts, none of its pages are in memory.

The process makes random references to its pages. Due to  **locality of reference** ,  after  referencing a page i, there is a 70% probability that the next reference will be to page  i, i-1, or i+1. i wraps around from 10  to 0. In other words, there is a 70%  probability that for a given i,  ∆i will be  -1, 0, or +1. Otherwise, |∆i| > 1.  

## Suggested procedure  
-  To compute the next i, first generate a  random number “r” from 0 through  10.  
-  If 0  ≤  r < 7, then generate a random  ∆i to be  -1, 0, or +1.  
-   For  7  ≤  r  ≤  10, randomly generate  the new page reference “j,”  2  ≤  |∆i|  ≤  9  
- [ 0  ≤  j  ≤  i-2  or  i+2  ≤  j  ≤  10]  

## Process Execution  
A process will always start  at page-0, then every 100 msec the process  references  another memory location using the above locality of  reference algorithm. Process  continues referencing memory till its duration expires.  For each memory reference  we need to collect statistics:

> <time-stamp in seconds,  process Name,  page-referenced, Page-in-memory, which process/page number will be evicted  if  needed>  

## Simulator  
Simulate the  page replacement  algorithms  FIFO, LRU, LFU, MFU, and  random  
pick:  
1.  Run simulator 5 times, each to complete the  one  minutes, and compute the  
hit/miss ratio of pages  referenced by the running jobs for each run. Then get  
average of 5 runs.  
2.  Run the simulator for 100 page references, and for each reference,  print the  
<time-stamp in seconds, process Name, page-referenced,  
if-Page-in-memory, which process/page number will be evicted  if needed>  

## Simulation  Execution  
Run each  page replacement  algorithm 5 times simulating 1 minute each time to get  an average of the  number of processes successfully swapped into memory (but not necessarily completed)  during the minute.  

For each  replacement  algorithm, print the average number of processes that were  successfully  Swapped-in.  

Memory map  for the 100 pages is defined as  <AAbbbACCAAbbbbbbbbCCC.... ddddddddddd... 33333>  where  the characters  are the process names (one character per MB) and the dots are holes (one per MB).

Each time a process is  swapped in  (start running)  or completes (exits  and therefore  is removed  from memory), print  a record  <time stamp, process name, Enter/exit,  Size  in Pages,  Service  Duration, Memory-map>.  

For each  replacement  algorithm, print the average number of processes (over the 5  runs) that were successfully swapped-in  (started execution)
